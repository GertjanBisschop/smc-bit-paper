	abstract = {Background: The amount of genome-wide molecular data is increasing rapidly, as is interest in developing methods appropriate for such data. There is a consequent increasing need for methods that are able to efficiently simulate such data. In this paper we implement the sequentially Markovian coalescent algorithm described by McVean and Cardin and present a further modification to that algorithm which slightly improves the closeness of the approximation to the full coalescent model. The algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree. Results: We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions, such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data, in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing coalescent algorithms. Conclusion: This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent models. © 2006 Marjoram and Wall; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {An infinite-site neutral allele model with crossing-over possible at any of an infinite number of sites is studied. A formula for the variance of the number of segregating sites in a sample of gametes is obtained. An approximate expression for the expected homozygosity is also derived. Simulation results are presented to indicate the accuracy of the approximations. The results concerning the number of segregating sites and the expected homozygosity indicate that a two-locus model and the infinite-site model behave similarly for 4Nu ≤ 2 and r ≤ 5u, where N is the population size, u is the neutral mutation rate, and r is the recombination rate. Simulations of a two-locus model and a four-locus model were also carried out to determine the effect of intragenic recombination on the homozygosity test ofWatterson (Genetics 85, 789-814; 88, 405-417) and on the number of unique alleles in a sample. The results indicate that for 4Nu ≤ 2 and r ≤ 10u, the effect of recombination is quite small. © 1983.},

However, using the model as the basis for inference is currently severely restricted by the computational challenge of estimating the likelihood. We discuss why the coalescent with recombination is so challenging to work with and explore whether simpler models, under which inference is more tractable, may prove useful for genealogy-based inference. We introduce a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation and as the basis for statistical inference. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

The technique is Metropolis-Hastings sampling: we explore a large number of possible reconstructions of the recombinant genealogy, weighting according to their posterior probability with regard to the data and working values of the parameters. Different relative rates of recombination at different locations can be accommodated if they are known from external evidence, but the algorithm cannot itself estimate rate differences. The estimates of ⌰ are accurate and apparently unbiased for a wide range of parameter values. However, when both ⌰ and r are relatively low, very long sequences are needed to estimate r accurately, and the estimates tend to be biased upward. We apply this method to data from the human lipoprotein lipase locus.},

	abstract = {We analyse sequential Markov coalescent algorithms for populations with demographic structure: for a bottleneck model, a population-divergence model, and for a two-island model with migration. The sequential Markov coalescent method is an approximation to the coalescent suggested by McVean and Cardin, and by Marjoram and Wall. Within this algorithm we compute, for two individuals randomly sampled from the population, the correlation between times to the most recent common ancestor and the linkage probability corresponding to two different loci with recombination rate R between them. These quantities characterise the linkage between the two loci in question. We find that the sequential Markov coalescent method approximates the coalescent well in general in models with demographic structure. An exception is the case where individuals are sampled from populations separated by reduced gene flow. In this situation, the correlations may be significantly underestimated. We explain why this is the case.},

	abstract = {T h e sampling distributions of several statistics that measure the association of alleles on gametes (linkage disequilibrium) are estimated under a two-locus neutral infinite allele model using an efficient Monte Carlo method. An often used approximation for the mean squared linkage disequilibrium is shown to be inaccurate unless the proper statistical conditioning is used. T h e joint distribution of linkage disequilibrium and the allele frequencies in the sample is studied. This estimated joint distribution is sufficient for obtaining an approximate maximum likelihood estimate of C = 4Nc, where N is the population size and c is the recombination rate. It has been suggested that observations of high linkage disequilibrium might be a good basis for rejecting a neutral model in favor of a model in which natural selection maintains genetic variation. I t is found that a single sample of chromosomes, examined at two loci cannot provide sufficient information for such a test if C {\textless} 10, because with C this small, very high levels of linkage disequilibrium are not unexpected under the neutral model. In samples of size 50, it is found that, even when C is as large as 50, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium conditional on the allele frequencies is substantially different from the distribution when there is no linkage between the loci. When conditioned on the number of alleles at each locus in the sample, all of the sample statistics examined a r e nearly independent of 6 = 4 N p , where p is the neutral mutation rate.},

Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm takes advantage of the Succinct Tree Sequence data structure that has allowed great advances in simulation and point estimation, but not yet probabilistic inference. Unlike previous methods, which employ the Sequentially Markov Coalescent approximation, ARGinfer uses the Coalescent with Recombination, allowing more accurate inference of key evolutionary parameters. We show using simulations that ARGinfer can accurately estimate many properties of the evolutionary history of the sample, including the topology and branch lengths of the genealogical tree at each sequence site, and the times and locations of mutation and recombination events. ARGinfer approximates posterior probability distributions for these and other quantities, providing interpretable assessments of uncertainty that we show to be well calibrated. ARGinfer is currently limited to tens of DNA sequences of several hundreds of kilobases, but has scope for further computational improvements to increase its applicability.},
